# ELADEB-R Self-Assessment Demo

This repository contains a very small demo web application implementing the basic principles of the ELADEB-R card sorting evaluation. It is written in vanilla HTML/JavaScript and stores data only in the browser.

The results page now summarises scores by thematic domain and stores each evaluation in `localStorage` with an anonymous code so you can track multiple sessions locally.

## Running

Open `index.html` in any modern browser. No build step is required.
